// React Router is a powerful library designed specifically for handling routing within React applications. It provides a declarative approach for defining routes, associating them with components, and managing the transition between views as users navigate your application.

// React Router provides the Link component, which acts like a regular <a> tag but integrates with the React routing system. Clicking a Link triggers navigation within your SPA without a full page reload.
